# Pokemon Paint

## Overview
This was my first foray into learning Web Audio API. The bulk of the project involved applying a pitch shift function to an array of Pokemon "cries" and then building out a drag & drop musical staff UI.

I have many ideas for features to add to Pokemon Paint (see Mario Paint screenshot), which I may return to.
